## Open Infrastructure for Verifiable Skills & Real Job Matching

Pexelle Market is the public-facing collaboration layer of the Pexelle ecosystem.

This repository exists to invite external experts to analyze, break, and improve a decentralized skill, evidence, and job-matching system built for real labor markets not academic abstractions.


If you are looking for a polished demo, this is not it.

If you want to test assumptions and find real weaknesses, welcome.

## What Pexelle Market Does

Pexelle Market connects to the Pexelle mobile app via QR-based authentication, allowing users to link their decentralized identity and skill graph without centralized accounts.

### Core capabilities:

- Evidence-backed skill profiles (immutable, cryptographically verifiable)

- Dynamic job applications (not static resumes)

- AI-generated learning roadmaps based on actual market demand

- Skill-gap detection per job

- Skill market intelligence (trend, demand, dependency graphs)

## Why This Exists

Static CVs are unverifiable.
Academic learning paths don’t map to hiring reality.
Trust in recruitment is broken.

### Pexelle Market enforces trust by design:

- Every skill claim must be backed by evidence

- Every evidence record is immutable

- Every job match is skill-graph–driven, not keyword-based

## What This Repo Is For

### We are explicitly inviting:

- Security researchers

- Blockchain & backend engineers

- Frontend engineers

- Data & graph engineers

- Product & UX critics

- Hiring-domain experts with technical depth

## You are expected to:

- Find bugs

- Challenge architectural decisions

- Stress-test security and trust models

- Propose improvements with reasoning

- Identify scalability and UX bottlenecks

- Opinions without evidence will be ignored.

## What This Repo Is NOT

- Not a résumé builder

- Not a generic learning platform

- Not a closed startup showcase

- Not a Web3 marketing repo

If you’re here for hype, leave.
If you’re here to improve the system, stay.
