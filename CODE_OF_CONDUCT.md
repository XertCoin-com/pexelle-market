# Code of Conduct | Pexelle Market

## Purpose

Pexelle Market is an **open, critical, and evidence-driven environment**.

This repository exists to be challenged.
Disagreement is expected.
Weak assumptions should be broken.

But this only works if discussions remain **professional, technical, and accountable**.

This Code of Conduct defines the minimum behavioral standards required to participate.

## Core Principles

### 1. Criticism Is Welcome — Noise Is Not

You are encouraged to:
- Challenge architecture
- Question assumptions
- Disagree strongly
- Propose alternatives

You are **not** encouraged to:
- Post opinions without evidence
- Repeat claims without reasoning
- Argue from authority or status
- Create discussion noise

**Claims must be backed by logic, data, or concrete experience.**

---

### 2. Respect the Work, Not the Ego

Attack ideas, not people.

Unacceptable behavior includes:
- Personal attacks
- Insults or sarcasm aimed at individuals
- Dismissive language without technical substance
- Mocking contributors or maintainers

Professional disagreement is not hostility.

---

### 3. No Hype, No Marketing, No Empty Praise

This is not a promotional space.

Avoid:
- Hype language
- “This is amazing” without analysis
- Evangelism without contribution
- Token participation

If you like something, explain **why**.
If you dislike something, explain **how it fails**.

---

### 4. Evidence Over Opinions

Statements such as:
- “This is insecure”
- “This won’t scale”
- “This UX is bad”

Must be accompanied by:
- A clear failure scenario
- A reproducible example
- A technical explanation
- Or a comparable real-world reference

Unsupported opinions may be ignored or closed.

---

### 5. Security Is Treated Seriously

- Do **not** publicly disclose security vulnerabilities.
- Follow the security disclosure policy.
- Responsible disclosure will be respected and credited.

Irresponsible disclosure may result in removal from the project.

---

### 6. Contribution Expectations

When opening:
- Issues
- Discussions
- Pull Requests

You are expected to include:
- Context
- Motivation
- Trade-offs
- Impact analysis (even if partial)

Blind PRs or cosmetic-only changes may be closed without review.

---

### 7. Enforcement

Maintainers may take action if behavior violates this Code, including:
- Comment removal
- Issue or PR closure
- Temporary or permanent bans

Decisions are made to protect **signal quality**, not feelings.

---

## Final Note

Pexelle Market is not designed to be comfortable.
It is designed to be correct.

If you are here to improve systems, you are welcome.
If you are here for validation, this is not the place.
